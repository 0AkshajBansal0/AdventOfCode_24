# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), an annual event that provides daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th! This repository contains my Python implementations for solving the challenges. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, learn new techniques, and have fun during the festive coding season.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code (AoC) is an online event that challenges programmers to solve two-part puzzles daily from December 1st through December 25th. The puzzles increase in difficulty as the event progresses, and participants can compete on leaderboards or tackle the problems at their own pace.

For more information, visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## Solutions

Each solution is written in Python and organized by day. Here's a quick overview:

| Day  | Puzzle Name                 | Completion Status |
|------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| Day 1 | [Puzzle Name](Day1/)        | ✅ Complete       |
| Day 2 | [Puzzle Name](Day2/)        | 🕗 In Progress    |
| Day 3 | [Puzzle Name](Day3/)        | ⏳ Pending        |

I aim to upload solutions daily. Each solution includes detailed comments explaining the logic and approach.

## Directory Structure

```
.
├── Day1
│   ├── input.txt      # Puzzle input for Day 1
│   ├── part1.py       # Solution for Part 1 of Day 1
│   └── part2.py       # Solution for Part 2 of Day 1
├── Day2
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── part1.py
│   └── part2.py
...
├── README.md          # This file
```

- Each `DayN` folder contains:
  - `input.txt`: The input data for that day's puzzle.
  - `part1.py`: The solution for Part 1 of the puzzle.
  - `part2.py`: The solution for Part 2 of the puzzle.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0AkshajBansal0/AdventOfCode_24.git
   cd AdventOfCode_24
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Navigate to the desired day's folder and run the solution:

   ```bash
   cd Day1
   python part1.py  # Run Part 1
   python part2.py  # Run Part 2
   ```

4. Replace `input.txt` with your own puzzle input if needed.
